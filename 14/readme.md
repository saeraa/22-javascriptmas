You are given a string s that consists of only lowercase English letters. If vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') are given a value of 1 and consonants are given a value of 2, return the sum of all the letters in the input string.

`for s = "abcde", the output should be countVowelConsonants(s) = 8`
